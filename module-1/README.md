# Advice App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

We use the AdviceSlip API ([https://api.adviceslip.com/advice]([https://api.adviceslip.com/advice]()))) to fetch an advice snippet, and display the data on the screen. This refreshes on pressing the ***"Get Advice"*** button.
